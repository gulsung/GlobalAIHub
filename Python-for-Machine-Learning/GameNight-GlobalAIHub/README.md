# Game Night

You are back at the office and the HR department organizes a welcome party for new employees. 

You decide to create a Rock-Paper-Scissor game. 

ðŸ“Œ Create a Rock-Paper-Scissor game in which the user plays against the computer. The player will choose one of the actions, and the computer will choose its action randomly.

```Python
#Import the random library
import random

#create a list containing the three actions of the game.
action_list = ["rock","paper","scissors"]

#Set the scores of players to 0
computer_score = 0
player_score = 0

#Ask the user how many rounds they want to play
total_rounds = input("How many rounds do you want to play? Please Enter a number here: ")

#Add a round_counter that is 0 at the beginning
round_counter = 0

#Write a while loop and put the game inside
while True:
  #Increase round_counter by and print it
  round_counter += 1
  print("Round number : ", round_counter)

  #Select a random action for computer
  computer_choice = random.choice(action_list)

  #Ask player to choose an action
  player_choice = input("Please Choice you're action: ")

  #Print the players choices
  print("Computer: ",computer_choice)
  print("Player: ",player_choice)

  #tie condition
  if computer_choice == player_choice:
    print("Tie! Both player choice a same action.")

  #Remaining conditions
  elif computer_choice == "paper":
    if player_choice == "rock":
      print("Winer is: computer")
      computer_score += 1
    else:
      print("Winer is: Player")
      player_score += 1
  elif computer_choice == "rock":
    if player_choice == "paper":
      print("Winer is: player")
      player_score += 1
    else:
      print("Winer is: Computer")
      computer_score += 1
  elif computer_choice == "scissors":
    if player_choice == "paper":
      print("Winer is: computer")
      computer_score += 1
    else:
      print("Winer is: player")
      player_score += 1

  #Stop the while loop if the round_counter equals the number of total rounds
  if round_counter == int(total_rounds):
    break

#Print the outcome of the game by using conditional statements
if computer_score == player_score:
  print("There is no winner, ", computer_score, ":", player_score)
elif computer_score > player_score:
  print("Computer won with score, ", computer_score, ":", player_score)
elif computer_score < player_score:
  print("Player won with score, ", computer_score, ":", player_score)
```

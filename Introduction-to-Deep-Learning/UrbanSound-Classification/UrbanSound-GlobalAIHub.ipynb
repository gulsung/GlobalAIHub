While much research has been done on audio files such as speech or music, work on ambient sound is relatively rare.\n","\n","Likewise, seeing recent advances in image classification where Convolutional Neural Networks are used to classify images with high accuracy raises the question of whether these methods can be used in other fields such as classification. Sound is also used or not. There are many real-world applications for what is taught in this material, which are described below.\n","\n","1. Content-based multimedia indexing and retrieval\n","2.

Your brain is constantly processing and understanding sound information and giving you information about the environment. A simple example would be the conversations you have with people on a daily basis. This talk is discussed by another person to continue the discussion. Even when you are thinking in a quiet environment, you tend to pick up very subtle sounds like rustling leaves or the sound of rain. This is the extent of your connection with sound.\n","\n","And can you somehow get the floating sounds around you to do something useful? Yes of course! Devices have been developed to help capture these sounds and can display them in a computer-readable format.
